# Python/Flask with MySQL template for Crafting Sandbox

This is a Python/[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) with MySQL template, configured for quick development setup in [Crafting Sandbox](https://docs.sandboxes.cloud/docs).

## Specifications

This template defines a single `/ping` route.
```python
@app.route('/ping')
def ping():
    ping = request.args.get('ping')
    if ping == "":
        ping = 'To ping, or not to ping; that is the question.'
    return jsonify(
        ping=ping,
        received_at=datetime.utcnow(),
    )
```

It accepts a ping query string, and responds with the query string and current time. For example:
```bash
$ curl --request GET 'localhost:3000/ping?ping=hello'
{"ping":"hello","received_at":"XXX, XX XXX XXXX XX:XX:XX GMT"}
```

[`.sandbox/manifest.yaml`](.sandbox/manifest.yaml) sets up sandbox in development mode (Debug Mode):
```yaml
- FLASK_APP=flaskr
- FLASK_ENV=development
```

These environment variables can also be set manually:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

Host is modified to `--host=0.0.0.0` to make the server publicly available. Port is also modified to `--port=3000`, which is the port defined in App configuration for the app.

[`config.py`](config.py) contains the mysql connection configuration. See the [flask mysql](https://flask-mysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#configuration) docs for more.

You can launch the app by running:
```bash
python3 -m flask run
```
